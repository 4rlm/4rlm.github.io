                    <p>No one knows widgets better than WidgetCo!  As a young 16 years old immigrant from Bavaria, Germany, Ulrich Meyer was determined to carry on the family tradition of making high quality widgets.  Since then, WidgetCo has grown to become one of the most premier manufacturers and wholesale distributors of all makes and models of widgets.  We stand behind our promise to deliver the highest quality widgets at the most competitive prices.  If you find a lower priced widget, let us know and we'll match the price!

                    <h4>The Early Days</h4>
                    <p>WidgetCo has a proud and proactive history of offering equal opportunities for all races, genders, religions, and abilities.  Our founder, Ulrich Meyer believed that a company should always reflect dignity and respect towards the community.  A pillar of that respect is respecting diversity and generous acts towards others.  WidgetCo also donates 10% of its profits to outreach programs and training programs for at-risk youth. </p>

                    <h4>Expansion</h4>
                    <p>Generations of dedication to engineering quality and customer service helped build our reputation as the most reliable and cost-efficient manufacturer and supplier of specialized widgets.  As our reputation spread, larger orders kept coming in.  To handle customers' larger orders we expanded our factory several times.  We are not a modern, busy plant, proudly employing over 5,000 people in our US facilities!</p>

                    <p>As the world embraced electronic devices, WidgetCo was there to help supply the widgets that make them work.  Although we still produce timeless widgets, our newer, more specialized widgets now comprise a larger and larger share of our orders.  We spend over 25% of our profits on research and development, and hold over 13,000 patents!  We are the leading manufacturer of widgets for the aerospace, medical device, and food processing industries.</p>
